	n2 = {Abstract Tropical and subtropical hydrological systems are important to water resource management. To improve understanding of these dynamical systems, it is useful to probe their relationship with relevant forcings. Historically, insolation is believed to be a major driver of these dynamics, testable using speleothem stable oxygen isotope ( {\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}delta {\}}\^{}{\{}18{\}}{$\backslash$}mathrm{\{}O{\}}{\$}) records, whose growth regions and precise chronologies enable detailed investigations of tropical/subtropical hydrology. Here we present a systematic analysis of long speleothem records examining the global relationship between {\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}delta {\}}\^{}{\{}18{\}}{$\backslash$}mathrm{\{}O{\}}{\$} and insolation across different timescales and regions. Our analysis reveals that the relationship between speleothem {\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}delta {\}}\^{}{\{}18{\}}{$\backslash$}mathrm{\{}O{\}}{\$} and insolation varies significantly by region, with no latitude, season, or periodicity of insolation bearing global relevance. We demonstrate that, when comparing speleothem {\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}delta {\}}\^{}{\{}18{\}}{$\backslash$}mathrm{\{}O{\}}{\$} to insolation curves, seasonal influence often cannot be distinguished from physical lags without additional constraints from modeling or theory. Most notably, we identify a previously unrecognized asymmetry whereby coherence in the precessional (19?23 kyr) band frequently collapses during glacial periods while maintaining power in the 100 kyr band. This suggests a fundamental reorganization of the hydrological cycle and its response to orbital forcing during glacial periods. Our results indicate that comparing speleothem {\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}delta {\}}\^{}{\{}18{\}}{$\backslash$}mathrm{\{}O{\}}{\$} to single insolation curves oversimplifies the complex relationship between orbital forcing and hydroclimate variability, highlighting our framework's utility for comprehensively exploring these interactions. These findings advance understanding of how mid-to-low latitude hydrology responds to external forcing?knowledge that may prove valuable as we face unprecedented {\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}text{\{}CO{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}2{\}}{\$}-driven climate change.},

	n2 = {Abstract Speleothem oxygen isotope records offer unique insights into Asian Monsoon evolution, with their precise chronologies used to identify abrupt climatic events. However, individual records are sometimes used to draw broad conclusions about global climate, without considering the dynamical context in which they exist. We present a robust framework for assessing the regional significance, and hence the potential global significance, of paleoclimate events, using the proposed Meghalayan age onset (associated with the ?4.2 ka event?) as a case study. Analyzing 14 well-dated speleothem oxygen isotope records from the SISAL v3 database and recent literature, we investigate the regional coherency of rapid shifts in Asian paleohydrology, which is the regional center of action for the proposed event, over the Holocene. Three robust methods fail to detect spatially coherent variability consistent with a 4.2 ka event across Asia, either because none exists or because it is of insufficient magnitude. In contrast, the 8.2 ka event is expressed in most records that resolve it. The absence of a clear isotopic excursion across this data set suggests that the ?4.2 ka megadrought? was not global, with important implications for archeology and geochronology. This casts doubt on the proposal that the 4.2 ka event marks the onset of a new geologic age. We do, however, observe support for a gradual isotopic enrichment between 3.9 and 3.6 ka, followed by partial recovery?consistent with the ?Double Drying? hypothesis and possibly related to changes in El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation variability.},

@article{Yang:ncomms2024,
	abstract = {Despite increased Atlantic hurricane risk, projected trends in hurricane frequency in the warming climate are still highly uncertain, mainly due to short instrumental record that limits our understanding of hurricane activity and its relationship to climate. Here we extend the record to the last millennium using two independent estimates: a reconstruction from sedimentary paleohurricane records and a statistical model of hurricane activity using sea surface temperatures (SSTs). We find statistically significant agreement between the two estimates and the late 20th century hurricane frequency is within the range seen over the past millennium. Numerical simulations using a hurricane-permitting climate model suggest that hurricane activity was likely driven by endogenous climate variability and linked to anomalous SSTs of warm Atlantic and cold Pacific. Volcanic eruptions can induce peaks in hurricane activity, but such peaks would likely be too weak to be detected in the proxy record due to large endogenous variability.},

@article{pseudoPAGES2k,
	abstract = {Paleoclimate reconstructions are now integral to climate assessments, yet the consequences of using different methodologies and proxy data require rigorous benchmarking. Pseudoproxy experiments (PPEs) provide a tractable and transparent test bed for evaluating climate reconstruction methods and their sensitivity to aspects of real-world proxy networks. Here we develop a dataset that leverages proxy system models (PSMs) for this purpose, which emulates the essential physical, chemical, biological, and geological processes that translate climate signals into proxy records, making these synthetic proxies more relevant to the real world. We apply a suite of PSMs to emulate the widely-used PAGES 2k dataset, including realistic spatiotemporal sampling and error structure. A hierarchical approach allows us to produce many variants of this base dataset, isolating the impact of sampling bias in time and space, representation error, sampling error, and other assumptions. Combining these various experiments produces a rich dataset (``pseudoPAGES2k'') for many applications. As an illustration, we show how to conduct a PPE with this dataset based on emerging climate field reconstruction techniques.},

@article{Manety:EDS2022,
	abstract = {Studying past climate variability is fundamental to our understanding of current changes. In the era of Big Data, the value of paleoclimate information critically depends on our ability to analyze large volume of data, which itself hinges on standardization. Standardization also ensures that these datasets are more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. Building upon efforts from the paleoclimate community to standardize the format, terminology, and reporting of paleoclimate data, this article describes PaleoRec, a recommender system for the annotation of such datasets. The goal is to assist scientists in the annotation task by reducing and ranking relevant entries in a drop-down menu. Scientists can either choose the best option for their metadata or enter the appropriate information manually. PaleoRec aims to reduce the time to science while ensuring adherence to community standards. PaleoRec is a type of sequential recommender system based on a recurrent neural network that takes into consideration the short-term interest of a user in a particular dataset. The model was developed using 1996 expert-annotated datasets, resulting in 6,512 sequences. The performance of the algorithm, as measured by the Hit Ratio, varies between 0.7 and 1.0. PaleoRec is currently deployed on a web interface used for the annotation of paleoclimate datasets using emerging community standards.},

@article{Zhu:ncomms2022,
	abstract = {The potential for explosive volcanism to affect the El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has been debated since the 1980s. Several observational studies, based largely on tree-ring proxies, have since found support for a positive ENSO phase in the year following large eruptions. In contrast, recent coral data from the heart of the tropical Pacific suggest no uniform ENSO response to explosive volcanism over the last millennium. Here we leverage paleoclimate data assimilation to integrate both tree-ring and coral proxies into a reconstruction of ENSO state, and re-appraise this relationship. We find only a weak statistical association between volcanism and ENSO, and identify the selection of volcanic events as a key variable to the conclusion. We discuss the difficulties of conclusively establishing a volcanic influence on ENSO by empirical means, given the myriad factors affecting the response, including the spatiotemporal details of the forcing and ENSO phase preconditioning.},

	url = {https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aay9165 %X Decadal climate variability and change affects nearly every aspect of our world, including weather, agriculture, ecosystems, and the economy. Predicting its expression is thus of critical importance on multiple fronts. Power et al. review what is known about tropical Pacific decadal climate variability and change, the degree to which it can be simulated and predicted, and how we might improve our understanding of it. More accurate projections will require longer and more detailed instrumental and paleoclimate records, improved climate models, and better data assimilation methods. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ®HJS Decadal climate variability in the tropical Pacific has global impact. Climate variability in the tropical Pacific affects global climate on a wide range of time scales. On interannual time scales, the tropical Pacific is home to the El NiÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ±oÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¬Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Decadal variations and changes in the tropical Pacific, referred to here collectively as tropical Pacific decadal variability (TPDV), also profoundly affect the climate system. Here, we use TPDV to refer to any form of decadal climate variability or change that occurs in the atmosphere, the ocean, and over land within the tropical Pacific. ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂºDecadal,ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¹ which we use in a broad sense to encompass multiyear through multidecadal time scales, includes variability about the mean state on decadal time scales, externally forced mean-state changes that unfold on decadal time scales, and decadal variations in the behavior of higher-frequency modes like ENSO.},

Models indicate that sulfate aerosols resulting from large eruptions can initiate an El Ni{\~n}o{\textendash}like response in the tropical Pacific, but observations have not shown evidence of such behavior.

They found a weak tendency for an El Ni{\~n}o{\textendash}like response in the year after an eruption, but not one that was statistically significant.

Modeling studies suggest that ENSO is sensitive to sulfate aerosol forcing associated with explosive volcanism but observational support for this effect remains ambiguous. Here, we used absolutely dated fossil corals from the central tropical Pacific to gauge ENSO{\textquoteright}s response to large volcanic eruptions of the last millennium. Superposed epoch analysis reveals a weak tendency for an El Ni{\~n}o{\textendash}like response in the year after an eruption, but this response is not statistically significant, nor does it appear after the outsized 1257 Samalas eruption. Our results suggest that those models showing a strong ENSO response to volcanic forcing may overestimate the size of the forced response relative to natural ENSO variability.},

The database contains 1319 records, including 157 from the Southern Hemisphere.

Models indicate that sulfate aerosols resulting from large eruptions can initiate an El Ni{\~n}o--like response in the tropical Pacific, but observations have not shown evidence of such behavior. Dee et al. present an oxygen-isotope time series of fossil corals from the central tropical Pacific to investigate ENSO's response to large volcanic eruptions during the past millennium. They found a weak tendency for an El Ni{\~n}o--like response in the year after an eruption, but not one that was statistically significant. These results suggest that large volcanic events have not triggered a detectable response in ENSO over the past thousand years and that their impact is small relative to the degree of natural variability.Science, this issue p. 1477The El Ni{\~n}o--Southern Oscillation (ENSO) shapes global climate patterns yet its sensitivity to external climate forcing remains uncertain. Modeling studies suggest that ENSO is sensitive to sulfate aerosol forcing associated with explosive volcanism but observational support for this effect remains ambiguous. Here, we used absolutely dated fossil corals from the central tropical Pacific to gauge ENSO's response to large volcanic eruptions of the last millennium. Superposed epoch analysis reveals a weak tendency for an El Ni{\~n}o--like response in the year after an eruption, but this response is not statistically significant, nor does it appear after the outsized 1257 Samalas eruption. Our results suggest that those models showing a strong ENSO response to volcanic forcing may overestimate the size of the forced response relative to natural ENSO variability.},

Previous studies have identified disagreements between paleoclimate reconstructions and climate model simulations with respect to the magnitude and recovery from volcanic cooling, questioning the fidelity of climate model simulations, reconstructions, or both. Using the paleoenvironmental data assimilation framework of the Last Millennium Reanalysis, this study investigates the causes of the disagreements, using both real and simulated data. We demonstrate that discrepancies since 1600 CE can be largely resolved by assimilating tree-ring density records only, targeting growing season temperature instead of annual temperature, and performing the comparison at proxy locales. Simulations of eruptions earlier in the last millennium may also reflect uncertainties in forcing and modeled aerosol microphysics.},

	abstract = {Paleoclimate reconstruction on the Common Era (1--2000 AD) provides critical context for recent warming trends. This work leverages integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) to conduct inference under a Bayesian hierarchical model using data from three sources: a state-of-the-art proxy database (PAGES 2k), surface temperature observations (HadCRUT4), and latest estimates of external forcings. INLA's computational efficiency allows to explore several model formulations (with or without forcings, explicitly modeling internal variability or not), as well as five data reduction techniques. Two different validation exercises find a small impact of data reduction choices, but a large impact for model choice, with best results for the two models that incorporate external forcings. These models confirm that man-made greenhouse gas emissions are the largest contributor to temperature variability over the Common Era, followed by volcanic forcing. Solar effects are indistinguishable from zero. INLA provide an efficient way to estimate the posterior mean, comparable with the much costlier Monte Carlo Markov Chain procedure, but with wider uncertainty bounds. We recommend using it for exploration of model designs, but full MCMC solutions should be used for proper uncertainty quantification.},

	abstract = {Multidecadal surface temperature changes may be forced by natural as well as anthropogenic factors, or arise unforced from the climate system. Distinguishing these factors is essential for estimating sensitivity to multiple climatic forcings and the amplitude of the unforced variability. Here we present 2,000-year-long global mean temperature reconstructions using seven different statistical methods that draw from a global collection of temperature-sensitive palaeoclimate records. Our reconstructions display synchronous multidecadal temperature fluctuations that are coherent with one another and with fully forced millennial model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 across the Common Era. A substantial portion of pre-industrial (1300--1800 ce) variability at multidecadal timescales is attributed to volcanic aerosol forcing. Reconstructions and simulations qualitatively agree on the amplitude of the unforced global mean multidecadal temperature variability, thereby increasing confidence in future projections of climate change on these timescales. The largest warming trends at timescales of 20 years and longer occur during the second half of the twentieth century, highlighting the unusual character of the warming in recent decades.},

@article{Fischer:2018,
	abstract = {Over the past 3.5 million years, there have been several intervals when climate conditions were warmer than during the pre-industrial Holocene. Although past intervals of warming were forced differently than future anthropogenic change, such periods can provide insights into potential future climate impacts and ecosystem feedbacks, especially over centennial-to-millennial timescales that are often not covered by climate model simulations. Our observation-based synthesis of the understanding of past intervals with temperatures within the range of projected future warming suggests that there is a low risk of runaway greenhouse gas feedbacks for global warming of no more than 2 $\,^{\circ}$C. However, substantial regional environmental impacts can occur. A global average warming of 1--2 $\,^{\circ}$C with strong polar amplification has, in the past, been accompanied by significant shifts in climate zones and the spatial distribution of land and ocean ecosystems. Sustained warming at this level has also led to substantial reductions of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, with sea-level increases of at least several metres on millennial timescales. Comparison of palaeo observations with climate model results suggests that, due to the lack of certain feedback processes, model-based climate projections may underestimate long-term warming in response to future radiative forcing by as much as a factor of two, and thus may also underestimate centennial-to-millennial-scale sea-level rise.},

	abstract = {Traditional approaches to ontology development have a large lapse between the time when a user using the ontology has found a need to extend it and the time when it does get extended. For scientists, this delay can be weeks or months and can be a significant barrier for adoption. We present a new approach to ontology development and data annotation enabling users to add new metadata properties on the fly as they describe their datasets, creating terms that can be immediately adopted by others and eventually become standardized. This approach combines a traditional, consensus-based approach to ontology development, and a crowdsourced approach where expert users (the crowd) can dynamically add terms as needed to support their work. We have implemented this approach as a socio-technical system that includes: (1) a crowdsourcing platform to support metadata annotation and addition of new terms, (2) a range of social editorial processes to make standardization decisions for those new terms, and (3) a framework for ontology revision and updates to the metadata created with the previous version of the ontology. We present a prototype implementation for the Paleoclimate community, the Linked Earth Framework, currently containing 700 datasets and engaging over 50 active contributors. Users exploit the platform to do science while extending the metadata vocabulary, thereby producing useful and practical metadata.},

	abstract = {The El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the leading mode of interannual climate variability. However, it is unclear how ENSO has responded to external forcing, particularly orbitally induced changes in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle during the Holocene. Here we present a reconstruction of seasonal and interannual surface conditions in the tropical Pacific Ocean from a network of high-resolution coral and mollusc records that span discrete intervals of the Holocene. We identify several intervals of reduced variance in the 2 to 7{$[$}thinsp{$]$}yr ENSO band that are not in phase with orbital changes in equatorial insolation, with a notable 64{\%} reduction between 5,000 and 3,000 years ago. We compare the reconstructed ENSO variance and seasonal cycle with that simulated by nine climate models that include orbital forcing, and find that the models do not capture the timing or amplitude of ENSO variability, nor the mid-Holocene increase in seasonality seen in the observations; moreover, a simulated inverse relationship between the amplitude of the seasonal cycle and ENSO-related variance in sea surface temperatures is not found in our reconstructions. We conclude that the tropical Pacific climate is highly variable and subject to millennial scale quiescent periods. These periods harbour no simple link to orbital forcing, and are not adequately simulated by the current generation of models.},

	abstract = {AbstractThis study formulates the design of optimal observing networks for past surface climate conditions as the solution to a data assimilation problem, given a realistic proxy system model (PSM), paleoclimate observational uncertainties, and a network of current and proposed observing sites. We illustrate the method with the design of optimal networks of coral {\^I}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}¬{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}¥18O records, chosen amongst candidate sites, and used to jointly infer sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface salinity (SSS) fields from the Community Climate System Model 4.0 Last Millennium simulation over the {$[$}1850, 2005{$]$} period. We show that an existing paleo-observing network accounts for \~{} 20{\%} of the SST variance, and that adding 25 to 100 optimal pseudo-coral sites would boost this fraction to 35 to 52{\%}. Characterizing the SST variance alone, or jointly with the SSS, leads to similar optimal networks, which justifies using coral {\^I}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}¬{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}¥18O records for SST reconstructions. In contrast, the network design for reconstructing SSS alone is fundamentally different, emphasizing the hydroclimatic centers of action of the El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation. In all cases, network design depends strongly on the amplitude of the observational error, so replicates may be more beneficial than the exploration of new sites; these replicates tend to be chosen where proxies are already informative of the large-scale climate field(s). Finally, we discuss extensions to other types of paleoclimatic observations, and outline a path to operationalization},

@article{Guillot_AOAS2015,
	abstract = {Understanding centennial scale climate variability requires data sets that are accurate, long, continuous and of broad spatial coverage. Since instrumental measurements are generally only available after 1850, temperature fields must be reconstructed using paleoclimate archives, known as proxies. Various climate field reconstructions (CFR) methods have been proposed to relate past temperature to such proxy networks. In this work, we propose a new CFR method, called GraphEM, based on Gaussian Markov random fields embedded within an EM algorithm. Gaussian Markov random fields provide a natural and flexible framework for modeling high-dimensional spatial fields. At the same time, they provide the parameter reduction necessary for obtaining precise and well-conditioned estimates of the covariance structure, even in the sample-starved setting common in paleoclimate applications. In this paper, we propose and compare the performance of different methods to estimate the graphical structure of climate fields, and demonstrate how the GraphEM algorithm can be used to reconstruct past climate variations. The performance of GraphEM is compared to the widely used CFR method RegEM with regularization via truncated total least squares, using synthetic data. Our results show that GraphEM can yield significant improvements, with uniform gains over space, and far better risk properties. We demonstrate that the spatial structure of temperature fields can be well estimated by graphs where each neighbor is only connected to a few geographically close neighbors, and that the increase in performance is directly related to recovering the underlying sparsity in the covariance of the spatial field. Our work demonstrates how significant improvements can be made in climate reconstruction methods by better modeling the covariance structure of the climate field.},

	abstract = {Pacific decadal variability (PDV) causes widespread, persistent fluctuations that affect climate, water resources, and fisheries throughout the Pacific basin, yet the magnitude, frequency, and causes of PDV remain poorly constrained. Here we present an absolutely dated, subannually resolved, 446 yr stable oxygen isotope ({\^I}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}¬{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}¥18O) cave record of rainfall variability in Vanuatu (southern Pacific Ocean), a location that has a climate heavily influenced by the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ). The {\^I}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}¬{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}¥18O-based proxy rainfall record is dominated by changes in stalagmite {\^I}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}¬{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}¥18O that are large ({\^a}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}¬{\`a}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}¬{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}º1{\^a}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}¬{\"A}$\,^{\circ}$), quasi-periodic ({\^a}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}¬{\`a}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}¬{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}º50 yr period), and generally abrupt (within 5--10 yr). These isotopic changes imply abrupt rainfall changes of as much as {\^a}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}¬{\`a}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}¬{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}º1.8 m per wet season, changes that can be {\^a}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}¬{\`a}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}¬{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}º2.5{\~A}{\^A}{\^A}{\^A}¬{\'o} larger than the 1976 C.E. shift in rainfall amount associated with a PDV phase switch. The Vanuatu record also shares little commonality with previously documented changes in the Intertropical Convergence Zone during the Little Ice Age or solar forcing. We conclude that multidecadal SPCZ variability is likely of an endogenous nature. Large, spontaneous, and low-frequency changes in SPCZ rainfall during the past 500 yr have important implications for the relative magnitude of natural PDV possible in the coming century.},

@article{Dutay10,
	abstract = {Abstract~~There is ongoing controversy as to the dynamical significance of geothermal heat flow in shaping the abyssal circulation. In this paper, we gauge the impact of geothermal heating and vertical mixing parameterizations in the general circulation model OPA. The experiments are evaluated by comparing simulated mantle 3He with observations collected during the GEOSECS and WOCE programs. This tracer is particularly adapted to the validation of our numerical simulations because its injection into the ocean interior is tightly linked to geothermal processes. In agreement with previous studies, the model circulation is found very sensitive to the parameterization of the vertical mixing. The meridional overturning circulation (MOC) is globally intensified when moving from a constant mixing to a version with enhanced mixing near the ocean bottom, with the most drastic variation observed for AABW (+&nbsp;50%). Adding the geothermal heat flux mainly affects AABW circulation in the model, enhancing it all the more as the meridional circulation is slow (low vertical mixing), but proportionally less so when it is more vigorous (enhanced vertical mixing). This can be understood from the requirement of the abyssal ocean to maintain heat balance. The evaluation with mantle 3He simulations reveals that the version with low vertical mixing, with its sluggish circulation, produces unrealistically high a 3He isotopic composition. However, with a vertical mixing that is enhanced at depth, the 3He distribution falls within an acceptable range of values in the deep ocean. Finally, adding the geothermal heating to this enhanced mixing case provides a substantial improvement of the simulation of AABW in all basins but the Indian Ocean. 3He isotopic composition is then in good agreement with the observations. Taken jointly with observational estimates of the MOC intensity, these independent isotopic constraints suggest that both geothermal heating and enhanced diapycnal mixing at depth are key ingredients in the realistic simulation of abyssal circulation. },
