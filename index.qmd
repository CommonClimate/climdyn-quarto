::: {#hero-heading}

I am a Professor in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Southern California, where I study low-frequency climate variability -- the [bassline of climate](https://forecastpod.org/2018/12/20/episode-50-julien-emile-geay/). My research focuses on understanding climate dynamics across multiple timescales, from seasonal to millennial, with particular emphasis on the tropical Pacific and its global teleconnections.

My work bridges paleoclimatology, climate dynamics, and data science, with a strong commitment to open science practices and reproducible research. I am passionate about building tools that make climate data and climate science more accessible to everyone.
