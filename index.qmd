## About

I am a Professor in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Southern California, where I study past climate variability using paleoclimate proxies and numerical models. My research focuses on understanding climate dynamics across multiple timescales, from seasonal to millennial, with particular emphasis on the tropical Pacific and its global teleconnections.

My work bridges paleoclimatology, climate dynamics, and data science, with a strong commitment to open science practices and reproducible research. I am passionate about developing new statistical methods for paleoclimate data analysis and building tools that make climate data more accessible to the broader scientific community.

## Research Interests

- **Paleoclimatology**: Reconstructing past climate variability from proxy records
- **Climate Dynamics**: Understanding mechanisms of climate variability and change
- **Data Science**: Developing statistical methods for climate data analysis
- **Open Science**: Promoting reproducible research and open data practices
