::: {#hero-heading}

I am a professor in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Southern California, where I lead the Climate Dynamics laboratory. We study low-frequency climate variability -- the [bassline of climate](https://forecastpod.org/2018/12/20/episode-50-julien-emile-geay/) across multiple timescales, from seasonal to millennial, to shed light on future climate risk on various horizons relevant to societies and ecosystems.

My work bridges paleoclimatology, climate dynamics and data science, with a strong commitment to open science practices and reproducible research. I am passionate about building tools that make climate data and climate science more accessible to everyone.
