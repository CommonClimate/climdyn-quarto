## Current Projects

### LinkedEarth
::: {.project-card}
**Community platform for paleoclimate data and knowledge**

LinkedEarth is a collaborative effort to build a community-curated knowledge base for paleoclimate data. The project includes standardized data formats, community databases, and analytical tools that make paleoclimate data more accessible and reusable.

- **Role**: Co-Principal Investigator
- **Funding**: NSF EarthCube
- **Website**: [linkedearth.org](https://linkedearth.org)

### ENSO Paleoclimate Reconstruction
::: {.project-card}
**Understanding El Niño variability through geological time**

This project uses paleoclimate proxy records to reconstruct El Niño-Southern Oscillation variability over the past several millennia. We're investigating how ENSO has responded to different climate states and external forcings.

- **Role**: Principal Investigator  
- **Funding**: NSF Paleoclimate Program
- **Collaborators**: NOAA, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution

### Tropical Pacific Climate Synthesis
::: {.project-card}
**Synthesizing paleoclimate records from the tropical Pacific**

A multi-institutional effort to compile and analyze paleoclimate records from across the tropical Pacific to understand large-scale climate patterns and their evolution through time.

- **Role**: Co-Investigator
- **Funding**: NSF Paleo Perspectives on Climate Change
- **Timeline**: 2022-2025

## Past Projects

### Climate Data Assimilation
::: {.project-card}
**Developing methods for paleoclimate data assimilation**

This project developed statistical frameworks for combining paleoclimate proxy data with climate model simulations to create spatially complete reconstructions of past climate.

- **Years**: 2018-2022
- **Funding**: NSF Climate Dynamics
- **Products**: New statistical methods, open-source software
