## Themes

My group's research focuses on **paleoclimatology** -- the study of past climates -- along the following themes. For more details, see our [publications](/publications.qmd).

### Climate Reconstruction

::: {.research-theme-row}
<img src="assets/img/theme-reconstruction.png" alt="Climate Reconstruction" class="theme-img">

::: {.theme-text}
Our group has been involved with reconstructions of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO, [@JEG10b; @Zhu:ncomms2022]), global mean surface temperature [@Barboza:2019; @Neukom:ngeo2019], and multiple fields [@LMR1; @Tardif:CP19]. We have also been active in benchmarking reconstruction techniques [@Wang_CP2014; @Wang_GRL15; @pseudoPAGES2k].

### Climate Modeling

::: {.research-theme-row}
<img src="assets/img/theme-modeling.png" alt="Climate Modeling" class="theme-img">

::: {.theme-text}
Our group has participated in the development [@Dee_JGR15] and evaluation of climate models, examining how models represent ENSO [@JEG_NatGeo2015], simulate volcanic eruptions [@Zhu:GRL2020], fractionate water isotopes [@Hu:jgr2018; @Hu:PP2019], and simulate the climate continuum [@Zhu:PNAS2019]. Paleoclimatology is particularly suited for model evaulation, as past climates provide an out-of-sample test of model predictions.

### Data Science

::: {.research-theme-row}
<img src="assets/img/theme-datascience.png" alt="Data Science" class="theme-img">

::: {.theme-text}
We develop methods for paleoclimate data assimilation [@LMR1; @cfr_2024], climate field imputation [@Guillot_AOAS2015; @Vaccaro:GraphEM], uncertainty quantification [@JEG_Tingley_CP2016; @Emile-Geay:2025], and time series analysis [@James_LERM:2024; @Pyleoclim:PP2022].
:::
:::

### Proxy Interpretation

::: {.research-theme-row}
<img src="assets/img/theme-proxy.png" alt="Proxy Interpretation" class="theme-img">

::: {.theme-text}
We have furthered understanding of how paleoclimate "[proxies](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/ecosystems-land-change-science-program/science/paleoclimate-proxies)" encode climate signals through proxy system models [@DMT_2011; @Dee_JGR15; @Dee:JAMES2016; @Dee_proxyScaling]. Alumni Jun Hu and Alex James have investigated speleothem records [@Hu:epsl17; @Hu:PP2019] on orbital [@James:PP2025] and shorter [@James:4.2ka] timescales.

### Open Science

::: {.research-theme-row}
<img src="assets/img/theme-openscience.png" alt="Open Science" class="theme-img">

::: {.theme-text}
A throughline of our research is open science, exemplified by data compilations [@PAGES2k_SD2017_allauthors; @Kaufman:2020a], data standards [@lipd_cp; @JEG_McKay2016; @PaCTS_v1], and open-source software [@geochronr-paper; @Pyleoclim:PP2022; @lipd-util; @cfr_2024].

## Current Projects

### LMR4D: P4CLIMATE — Connecting Seasonal to Millennial Timescales through Strongly Coupled Data Assimilation
::: {.project-card}
::: {.project-meta}
**NSF P4CLIMATE AGS-2402475** | Co-PI (PI: G. Hakim, UW) | 2024–2026
:::

LMR4D is the latest iteration of the [Last Millennium Reanalysis](https://cpo.noaa.gov/last-millennium-reanalysis-now-at-noaas-national-centers-for-environmental-information-marking-major-milestone/) implementing a 4D variational (4DVAR) data assimilation framework — the same approach used in operational numerical weather prediction — to produce seasonally resolved temperature reconstructions over the Common Era. LMR4D will leverage data from new sources, including documentary evidence, marine sediments, annually-resolved marine bivalve chronologies, as well as boreholes.
The resulting seasonally resolved reconstruction will be applied to (A1) simulate tropical cyclone track and intensity statistics using deep-learning weather models (Pangu-Weather, FourCastNet, DLWP), extending TC records by centuries and enabling the first millennial-scale simulations of tropical cyclone statistics, and (A2) characterize sources of climate variability across the seasonal-to-centennial continuum, including volcanic forcing responses and constraints on equilibrium climate sensitivity. LMR4D products will be  publicly accessible via [PReSto](https://paleopresto.com) and NOAA NCEI; the 4DVAR algorithm and proxy system models will be shared on GitHub, with reproducible workflows distributed via [PaleoBooks](https://linked.earth/PaleoBooks/). The project is training two graduate students and several undergraduates.

### PaleoPAL: An AI Research Assistant for Paleoclimatology
::: {.project-card}
::: {.project-meta}
**NSF CAIG RISE 2425885** | Co-PI | 2025–2027
:::

PaleoPAL leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) – Large Language Model (LLM) framework to create an AI assistant for paleoclimatology, enabling scientists to search for datasets, methods, and workflows appropriate to their research problem directly from a Jupyter Notebook. The project targets three critical research areas: placing recent El Niño variations in the context of the last 10,000 years, detecting climate tipping points and their potential precursors, and generating empirically-based, low-cost climate projections. By embedding AI directly into the practice of paleoclimatology through a familiar Jupyter interface, PaleoPAL aims to lower technical and conceptual barriers to sophisticated analyses across the paleoclimate community.

### PaleoCube: Enabling Cloud-Based Paleoclimatology
::: {.project-card}
::: {.project-meta}
**NSF EarthCube ICER 2126510** | Co-PI | 2021-2024
:::

PaleoCube proposes to lower technical and social barriers that prevent full use of paleoclimate observations by bringing scientists to work in the Cloud. The project extends existing cyberinfrastructure (LinkedEarth, Pangeo, Jupyter) to bring cutting-edge capabilities to paleoclimate scientists through cloud-based workflows, hackathons, and community engagement.

## Past Projects

### FROGS: Facilitating Reproducible Open GeoScience
::: {.project-card}
**NSF GEO OSE Track 1 RISE-2324732** | Co-PI | 2024-2026

Building open science capacity in the geosciences through the [LeapFROGS](https://linked.earth/LeapFROGS/) training platform and a series of hands-on workshops (PyRATES, FAIRLeap, Open Geoscience Hackathon). Three workshops engaged 56 participants across more than a dozen geoscience subfields and career stages, producing 8 reproducible notebooks and 9 open-source software packages. Post-event surveys showed over 90% of participants gained confidence in applying FAIR and reproducible research methods.
