## Current Projects

### CyberPaleo
::: {.project-card}
**Ushering in the future of past climates**

Just because paleogeosciences study the past, doesn't mean they need to stay stuck in it. Until recently, people were mostly using Excel as their main tool to store, share, and analyze paleoclimate data. While spreadsheets have their place in the paleo workflow, they also severely limit the interpretability of the underlying data by humans and machines. Much of my recent and present work addresses these challenges by leveraging information technology.

- **Key Components**: LiPD data standard, LinkedEarth ontology, Pyleoclim analysis tools
- **Website**: [linkedearth.org](https://linkedearth.org)

### PaleoCube
::: {.project-card}
**Enabling Cloud-Based Paleoclimatology**

The world is moving towards cloud-based workflows for nearly everything, and there is no reason that paleoclimate research should be left behind. **PaleoCube**, recently funded by the NSF EarthCube program, will build on existing cyberinfrastructure to bring cutting-edge capabilities to the fingertips of climate scientists.

- **Role**: Co-Principal Investigator
- **Funding**: NSF EarthCube
- **Led by**: Deborah Khider (USC) with Nick McKay (NAU)

### Paleoclimate Data Assimilation
::: {.project-card}
**Fusing models and observations to generate insights**

The study of low-frequency climate variations is fundamentally limited by the shortness of the instrumental record. Paleoclimate observations offer a way out, but are typically sparse, noisy, and indirect. Data assimilation techniques can optimally combine information from climate models, paleoclimate observations, and instrumental datasets.

- **Key Innovation**: Kalman filter-based reconstruction methods
- **Products**: Last Millennium Reanalysis (LMR)
- **Funding**: NOAA Climate Program Office

### Big Data for Paleo
::: {.project-card}
**Data Science for paleohydrology and translational paleoclimatology**

The paleoclimate record offers unique constraints on Earth system models used for climate projections. This study takes advantage of cutting-edge paleoclimate data compilations (e.g. SISAL) to answer fundamental questions: How synchronous are hydroclimate regime transitions since the last deglaciation?

- **Team**: USC, UT Austin, UCLA collaboration
- **Funding**: NSF P2C2 (grant 2002558)
- **Innovation**: PaleoHack workshops for community training

### PReSto
::: {.project-card}
**A paleoclimate reconstruction storehouse**

Paleoclimate reconstructions are the most widely used scientific product from the paleoclimate community. However, they are infrequently updated and commonly lag years behind the latest data and methods. **PReSto** will provide continuously-updated reconstructions with broad web access.

- **Lead**: Nick McKay (NAU)
- **Funding**: NSF Geoinformatics (EAR 1948822)
- **Focus**: Common Era and Holocene reconstructions
