## Themes

My research focuses on **paleoclimatology** - the study of past climate variations using proxy records from trees, corals, sediments, and ice. I develop statistical methods, data standards, and computational tools to extract climate insights from these diverse archives. Key themes include:

- **Data Standards & Cyberinfrastructure**: Building community platforms for paleoclimate data (LinkedEarth, LiPD format)
- **Statistical Methods**: Paleoclimate data assimilation, uncertainty quantification, and time series analysis
- **Climate Dynamics**: ENSO variability, volcanic forcing, and hydroclimate transitions
- **Open Science**: Reproducible workflows, cloud computing, and community-driven research

## Current Projects

### PaleoCube: Enabling Cloud-Based Paleoclimatology
::: {.project-card}
::: {.project-meta}
**NSF EarthCube ICER 2126510** | Co-PI | $290,283 (USC portion) | 2021-2024
:::

PaleoCube proposes to lower technical and social barriers that prevent full use of paleoclimate observations by bringing scientists to work in the Cloud. The project extends existing cyberinfrastructure (LinkedEarth, Pangeo, Jupyter) to bring cutting-edge capabilities to paleoclimate scientists through cloud-based workflows, hackathons, and community engagement.

### A Big Data Approach to Fundamental Paleoclimate Questions
::: {.project-card}
::: {.project-meta}
**NSF P2C2 AGS 2002518** | Lead PI | $398,099 (USC portion) | 2020-2023
:::

Applying Big Data approaches to address fundamental questions in climate dynamics: (1) the spatial extent of abrupt changes in hydroclimate, and (2) how knowledge of past temperature variations can help reduce uncertainty in twenty-first century climate projections. Links paleoclimate data to CMIP6 climate model projections.
