## Research Overview

My research focuses on understanding climate variability and change across multiple timescales, from seasonal to millennial. I use paleoclimate proxy records, numerical climate models, and statistical methods to investigate:

### Paleoclimatology
- Reconstructing past climate from coral, tree ring, and ice core records
- Understanding how tropical climate systems have varied over geological time
- Developing new statistical methods for paleoclimate data analysis

### Climate Dynamics  
- Investigating the mechanisms behind El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
- Studying tropical-extratropical climate teleconnections
- Understanding climate system responses to external forcing

### Data Science for Climate
- Building statistical frameworks for climate data analysis
- Developing open-source tools for the paleoclimate community
- Promoting reproducible research practices

## Teaching & Mentoring

I am passionate about education and have taught courses ranging from introductory earth science to graduate-level paleoclimatology. I mentor undergraduate and graduate students in research projects that combine fieldwork, laboratory analysis, and computational methods.

## Open Science

I am committed to open science practices, including:
- Making research code and data publicly available
- Contributing to community databases and software tools
- Promoting reproducible research workflows
- Supporting early-career scientists through mentoring and collaboration

## Personal

When I'm not researching climate, I enjoy hiking, photography, and exploring the natural beauty of Southern California. I'm also passionate about science communication and regularly engage with the public through talks, media interviews, and social media.
