Official start of the [PaleoCube](../projects.qmd) project! We are super excited to starting bringing paleoclimate data and models to the Cloud, for easier, niftier, more reproducible, and more didactic analyses. 

Please follow the [CyberPaleo Medium.com channel](https://medium.com/cyberpaleo) for updates. For details, see [this blog post](https://medium.com/cyberpaleo/announcing-the-next-linkedearth-chapter-paleocube-790778b6ffb0).

This NSF EarthCube-funded project will revolutionize how paleoclimatologists work with data and models, bringing cloud-based workflows to the paleoclimate community.
